# shoreline-monitor-sandbox
Welcome to the ShorelineMonitor sandbox environment.This is a repository that allows researchers and users to conduct in-depth analyses on historic and projected coastal change at a local, regional to global scale.

Visit the ShorelineMonitor website to explore the global dataset interactively. To use the underlying global dataset you need to use the CoastPy module, developed by Floris Calkoen during his PhD work. 
Details about the Global Shoreline Change datasets can be find in Luijendijk et al. 2018. A updated study is work in progress. 

To access the data, you will now need a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token. Tokens are available upon reasonable request from Deltares.

### Installation
For accessing the data, we use CoastPY
